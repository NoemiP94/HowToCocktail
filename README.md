# 🍸How to Cocktail🍹

An Android app where you can search the recipe of your favourite drink!

You can search for your recipe using the search bar or the list of categories.

## ⚙️How to install
This project is developed using **React Native**, **Paper** components and a third-part [API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
 For the style, I was inspired by a mockup that I found in the **Figma** community.
1)   Clone this repository in your PC and open with your *Visual Studio Code*
2)   Add **nodemodules** folder by running:
```bash
npm install
```
3) Open your Android emulator or connect your device.
4) Start the project by running:
```bash
npx expo start
```
5) Enjoy!
